Love is no excuse for what we're doing
For we both know that's two hearts could break
We tell ourselves we've got to have each other but love is no excuse for us to make
Sure we love each other and it could be so right
But not if someone else have got to pay
Our love for each other looks good in the night
But our love can never see the light of day
It's been going on for much too long now and our wrongs have mounted one by one
We tell ourselves it's cause we love each other
But love is no excuse for what we've done
[ Steel ]
Sure we love each othe...
