Bad art
Is still art
But that's no excuse for you

Rage is a commodity
As hot as it gets
Sold on the corner
And swopped on the net
I see it in a film
And I'm feeling abused
Bad art
Can I be excused?

And you can say what you think
(That's no excuse)
About the driving and drink
(It's just abuse)
You shoulda poured down the sink
(That's no excuse)
And then pulled back from the brink
(It's just abuse)

No one dared to say
When he was free and alive
That Ronnie Kray was gay
Because they wouldn't survive
Anger gives you energy
And instant relief
Frankly, my dear
I don't need the grief

And you can say what you think
(That's no excuse)
About the driving and drink
(It's just abuse)
You shoulda poured down the sink
(That's no excuse)
And then pulled back from the brink
(It's just abuse)

(No excuse
No excuse)

Bad art
Is still art
But that's no excuse for you

That's no excuse
It's just abuse
That's no excuse
It's just abuse

(No excuse
No excuse)
